    Do you know the old joke "How do you put an elephant into a fridge?"

    "Open the fridge, put in the elephant, and close the door". Try it, we
    delivered a fresh elephant into your kitchen!

$ cd kitchen
$ ls
elephant fridge/
$ mv elephant fridge

    [The elephant does not fit into the fridge]

    Oh, it doesn't seem to be that easy. Can you find out how big the file
    is? The man page of ls will help you!

$ ls
elephant fridge/
$ man ls

[Display of the man page, skipped here]

$ ls -l
-rw------- 1 seb users 10485760 27. Okt 22:25 elephant
drwx------ 2 seb users     4096 27. Okt 22:25 fridge

    Okay, about ten million bytes. ls has the option -h to display that in
    a more comprehensible order of magnitude.

$ ls -sh
 10M elephant   4.0K fridge

    10 megabytes? Indeed, the fridge isn't that large.

    We have to make the elephant smaller. There are several ways to
    compress files - one of the most common under Linux is gzip.
    Compress the elephant with that program and look at it's size again.

$ gzip -f elephant
$ ls -sh
 3.4M elephant.gz  4.0K fridge

    That sounds much better.

    Because that went so well, we've delivered a second elephant to the
    hallway. Get it into the kitchen and and compress it, this time with
    bzip2. How large is the file this time?

$ ls ..
bedroom/ elephant2 kitchen/ livingroom/
$ cp ../elephant2 .
$ bzip2 -f elephant2
$ ls -sh
1.9M elephant2.bz2  3.4M elephant.gz  4.0K fridge

    The bzip2 compression algorithm takes more time, but creates smaller
    files.

    The two compressed elephants now fit in the fridge comfortably! (Hint:
    Using wildcards you can move both files at once!)

$ mv elephant* fridge

    These commands only compress single files. To compress a folder, you
    have to combine it and its contents to a single file, you can do that
    with tar -c -f name_of_the_archive.tar folder.

    -c stands for "create", -f for the name of the resulting file. tar is
    short for "tape archive" originates from the good old times, when
    magnetic tapes were used to store files.

    Please combine the fridge to fridge.tar.

$ tar -c -f fridge.tar fridge

    The compression commands replace the original file, but tar
    leaves the source folder intact. Please delete the original fridge.

$ rm -rf fridge

    Good, and now compress the so-called "tar ball" with a compression
    method of your choice.

$ gzip fridge.tar

    You can now pick up the compressed fridge with the compressed
    elephants, put it in your pocket and take it with you. :-)

    And eventually, we want to get the elephants back. Reverse your steps
    and put both elephants back into the kitchen.

    Use the commands gunzip and bunzip2, as well as tar with the arguments
    -x -f name_of_the_archive.tar (-x means "extract").

$ tar xzf fridge.tar.gz
$ gunzip fridge/elephant.gz

    [The elephant does not fit into the fridge]

$ bunzip2 fridge/elephant2.bz2

    [The elephant does not fit into the fridge]

    Enjoy your meal! When you're ready to complete the lesson, say "done"!

$ echo done
done
