\begin{abstract}
    Command line interfaces provide powerful, expressive means to interact with computers, but compared to graphical user interfaces, they have a steep learning curve. Inspired by text adventures, this thesis introduces a new interface concept for teaching command line programs: An interactive, terminal-based tutorial environment, where the documentation reacts to the user's commands, to the command line's response and its internal state.

    The thesis covers design, implementation, application and evaluation of the \emph{Nut Shell}, a software framework for creating those tutorials.

    An abstraction layer is devised that gives the framework uniform access to the different parts of interaction within arbitrary command line programs, while retaining all their builtin editing features. The framework is compatible with system shells and many interpreted programming languages, but can also be used to teach subtopics, like specific command line tools or concepts.

    The Nut Shell introduces a new domain specific language, that can be used to describe tutorial lessons. The language's syntactic structures are tailored for this purpose and thus allow for fast and easy content creation. A built-in testing facility enables authors to check their tutorials for proper function automatically.

    In a two-week evaluation study with about 120 participants, a tutorial created with the Nut Shell proved superior to a teaching method based on static text: Users of the Nut Shell showed a much higher motivation to attend to the course, said they had more fun and learned more, and were able to work more autonomously.

\begin{abstract}
    Kommandozeilen-Interfaces sind eine mächtige, ausdrucksstarke Art und Weise, mit Computern zu interagieren, sie haben allerdings eine steilere Lernkurve als grafische Inferfaces. Diese Bachelorarbeit stellt ein neuartiges Interfacekonzept zum Lehren von Kommandozeilen-Programmen vor, das durch Textadventures inspiriert ist: Eine interaktive, Terminal-basierte Lernumgebung, deren Anleitungstext auf die Befehle des Benutzers, auf die Antwort der Kommandozeile sowie ihren internen Zustand reagiert.

    Die Arbeit umfasst Design, Implementierung, Anwendung und Evaluierung der \emph{Nut Shell}, einem Softwareframework zum Erstellen solcher Tutorials.

    Eine Abstraktionsschicht wird entworfen, die dem Framework einheitlichen Zugriff auf die verschiedenen Bestandteile der Interaktion innerhalb beliebiger Kommandozeilenproramme erlaubt, wobei deren eingebaute Editierfunktionen benutzbar bleiben. Das Framework ist kompatibel mit System-Shells und vielen interpretierten Programmiersprachen, kann aber auch verwendet werden, um Unterthemen zu lehren, wie etwa spezielle Kommandozeilenwerkzeuge oder -konzepte.

    Für die Nut Shell wurde eine neue domänenspezifische Sprache entwickelt, in der die Tutoriallektionen geschrieben werden können. Die syntaktischen Strukturen der Sprache sind für diesen Zweck maßgeschneidert und machen deshalb das Erstellen von Inhalten schnell und einfach. Eine eingebaute Test-Infrastruktur ermöglicht es Autoren, ihre Tutorials automatisch auf korrekte Funktionsweise zu überprüfen.

    In einer zweiwöchigen Auswertung mit etwa 120 Teilnehmern zeigte ein mit der Nut Shell erstelltes Tutorial klare Vorteile gegenüber einem Lehransatz, der auf statischem Text basierte: Benutzer der Nut Shell waren motivierter, an dem Kurs teilzunehmen, sie hatten mehr Spaß, lernten mehr, und konnten selbstständiger arbeiten.

\chapter{Introduction}

These days, the most common method for humans to operate computers is via a graphical user interface. It provides buttons and other visual elements the user can interact with using a mouse. Before this interaction method was invented, however, computers had a text-only interface. The user would type a text command, and the machine would execute it. These \emph{command line interfaces} (CLIs) provide powerful, efficient means to interact with computers, which is why many people still can benefit from learning how to use them. But CLIs often have a steep learning curve: Unlike graphical user interfaces, they are not self-evident---users have to know which commands they can enter, which is why novice users definitely need guidance.

Most approaches to teach command line interfaces involve static text: There are books and manuals, online tutorials and exercise sheets. These mediums have several drawbacks: The users have to shift their attention back and forth between the explaining text and the system they want to learn, which slows down the learning process. The text might set tasks and goals, but has no possibility to check and confirm when the user reaches them. Finally, when the user makes a syntactical or semantical mistake, he is on his own---the text remains static and cannot help or correct him.

This thesis describes a system that provides a much more direct, interactive teaching approach. The core idea is to interweave the tutorial text and the output of the command line system and to make the tutorial watch the user's commands, as well as the command line system's state and output, to allow direct response to the user's actions.

This approach is inspired by text adventures. \Cref{fig:zork} shows one of the earliest programs of this kind, \textsc{Zork}, originally released in 1979 by members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group \cite{infocom}. In this game, the player types short commands of what he wants to do, and the game responds with a description of what effects these actions produce. Tutorials for technical systems could work similarly: They could provide direct feedback to the user's commands and support him when he makes mistakes or has problems (note \textsc{Zork}'s response to \texttt{examine mailbox}).

\end{figure}

Goal of this thesis is to design, implement, apply and evaluate a framework that allows the creation of command line tutorials with this interactive teaching approach. This framework has been called the \emph{Nut Shell}, in reference to the term \emph{in a nutshell} (“to the point”, “short and sweet”).

\section{Prior work}

\emph{Try Ruby} was an interactive online tutorial that would provide an introduction to the Ruby scripting language in the web browser. A notable anonymous programmer called “\_why” first published it at the end of 2005, to the author's knowledge, this was the first attempt at creating interactive command line tutorials \cite{why05}. The interface was split in two halves: One side contained the current task, the other side held an interactive Ruby prompt. The user would then type in commands, and the application would check whether either the command or the interpreter's output matched a regular expression. In this case, the current exercise would be solved and the tutorial would advance to the next one.
The site went offline in early 2009, but some members of the Ruby community continue development.

A website called \emph{Codecademy}\footnote{\url{http://www.codecademy.com}} currently deploys several interactive tutorials, which focus on teaching programming in Ruby, Python, JavaScript and PHP. The tutorials consist of multiple exercises, in each of which the user is given a piece of unfinished code as well as a task. He is then supposed to fix or complete the code so that it satisfies some conditions, which can be quite complex. Every time the code is saved, the conditions are checked. On success, the tutorial advances to the next exercise.

The site \emph{Code School}\footnote{\url{http://www.codeschool.com}} follows a very similar approach: It offers courses about Ruby, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, R and Git, which are designed similar to Codecademy's. The company behind \textsc{Code School} is also responsible for \emph{Try Git}\footnote{\url{http://try.github.io}} and the current \emph{Try Ruby} implementation\footnote{\url{http://tryruby.org}}, which both work similarly to the original \emph{Try Ruby}.

While these implementations of interactive tutorials pose drastic improvements over classical, static tutorials, they still have several problems: The courses are linear---each task has to be solved to get to the next one, which is inflexible and allows no adaption to the individual user.

Furthermore, they do not offer the level of persistence that normal interaction with the command line has: Every entered line is run separately, the system has no internal state. For example, when the user defines a variable, it is lost when entering the next line, because the interpreter is restarted. \emph{Try Ruby} tries to circumvent this restriction by re-executing each command that was entered so far, which slows down the system's response speed over time.

While the applications provide some command editing capabilities, it is not possible to use comfort functions like searching the command history or using tab-completion. As these techniques are essential for efficient usage of these interfaces, this is a major drawback.

To present the tutorials in a web browser ensures easy, universal access without any setup at all. However, this way there is no way to incorporate local files or programs in the tutorials, and the step away from the online tutorial towards the “real” command line environment will make a drastic difference.

The Nut Shell addresses all of these shortcomings: Tutorials can be highly nonlinear, the command line program's state is persistent during a lesson, all editing facilities are kept available and the tutorial is presented in the same environment where it is commonly used---in the terminal.

\section{Overview and organization}

The structure of the chapters follows a bottom-up fashion:

\Cref{sec:preliminaries} introduces and defines some of the framework's central topics and terms: \emph{Command line interfaces}, \emph{Terminals}, and related technologies.

\Cref{sec:cliparser} describes the low-level abstraction layer that communicates with the command line process at the core of each Nut Shell tutorial. It explains and demonstrates techniques for adapting to many different command line interfaces and names the requirements the CLIs need to fulfill.

\Cref{sec:lang} specifies details of the domain specific language \emph{nutsh}, which builds upon the command line abstraction layer to allow simple, fast creation of new Nut Shell tutorials. It describes the language's lexical elements, its syntax and semantics and explains how the language is interpreted and tested.

\Cref{sec:evaluation} describes application and evaluation of the Nut Shell in a study that compared the new teaching approach with tutorials based on static text, and tried to find out whether the former offers any benefits.

%\Cref{sec:implementation} provides an overview of the Nut Shell's implementation and describes usage and installation.

\Cref{sec:nutshexample} starting on \cpageref{sec:nutshexample} shows an example session of a tutorial created for the evaluation, followed by its \emph{nutsh} source code. To get an impression of the interaction style employed by the Nut Shell, it might be beneficial to look at this example before continuing to read.

\section{Notation}
\label{sec:ebnf}

In this thesis, grammars are specified using the \emph{Extended Backus-Naur Form} (EBNF) as defined in \cite{wirth77}. As a convention, capitalized names represent nonterminal symbols, while lowercase names represent terminal symbols. Vertical bars (\texttt{|}) separate alternatives, square brackets (\texttt{[ ]}) denote optional parts and curly brackets (\texttt{\{ \}}) denote zero or more repetitions. Tokens are enclosed in double quotes or back quotes.

Grammars are displayed in the following style---this is also a specification of the EBNF flavour as used in this thesis, given in EBNF itself:

\begin{ebnf}
Grammar     = { Production } .
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
\end{ebnf}

\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

\section{Command line interfaces}
\label{sec:cli}

A \emph{command line interface} (\textsc{CLI}) allows a user to communicate with a computer program by entering lines of text, the \emph{command lines}.
%This thesis focuses on purely character-based command line interfaces that have no graphical capabilities.

Commonly, interaction with a \textsc{CLI} consists of three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The program writes a \emph{prompt}, a special character sequence that signals to the user that the program now expects a command.
    \item The user composes a command line. Often, the CLI offers several editing capabilities that make this process more comfortable, like a command history or completion of non-ambiguous terms when pressing \keys{Tab}. To tell the program to execute the command, the user usually sends a \emph{line feed} character by pressing the \keys{Return} key.
    \item The program interprets and executes the command, and displays a response. Sometimes, the execution is \emph{interactive} and requires further input. After the command has finished, the first phase starts again.
\end{enumerate}

In this thesis, the examples will use IRB, the \emph{Interactive Ruby Shell}. Ruby is an object-oriented scripting language, and, at the basic level, can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions. \Cref{fig:irb} shows a few iterations of the three phases mentioned above: The characters \texttt{>\->} constitute the prompt; the following characters, set in a bold typeface, are the commands the user typed; and the subsequent lines are the program's output.

\begin{figure}[tb]

=> true
    \end{lstlisting}
    \centering
    \caption{An example IRB session.}
    \label{fig:irb}
\end{figure}

\label{sec:cliexamples}

Another very common command line program is called \emph{Bash}, the default system shell on Linux and Mac OS X, which can be used to manipulate the file system. It supports some convenient functions like tab-completion of filenames or advanced access to the command history and offers many syntactic structures for manipulating streams of text.

Further examples of command line programs include interpreters of the programming languages \emph{Python}, \emph{Haskell} or \emph{Perl}, SQL consoles or mathematics software like \emph{gnuplot} or \emph{Sage}.

\section{Terminal}

In the past, a \emph{computer terminal} was a device for communication with mainframe computers. They read text from the user via a keyboard and displayed the computer's output, first on paper, later on a screen.

Here, when we use the term \emph{terminal}, we mean a modern \emph{terminal emulator}, a program that resembles a computer terminal within an otherwise graphical environment. Inside these terminal emulators, command line programs can be run.

Terminals communicate through sequential streams of characters: They receive characters from the user's keyboard, send them to the program running inside, and they receive characters back from the program to be displayed on the screen.

\section{Escape sequences and control characters}

Not only are terminals able to output text, they also have provide methods to influence its appearance and format.

Nowadays, modern terminal emulators mimic the behaviour of the classical computer terminal \textsc{VT100}, introduced in 1978 by \textsc{Digital Equipment Corporation} \cite{upt02}. This device had the following mechanism for influencing the output: When given special character sequences to display, the terminal performed predefined actions like moving the cursor, deleting characters on the screen or turning graphical modes (underlining, colors) on or off. Because these sequences “escape” their normal path of being displayed as text, they are called \emph{escape sequences}, and in this case indeed start with an \emph{escape} character. The \textsc{VT100} was not the first terminal to handle those sequences, but its popularity caused widespread support for its set of escape sequences, that were later specified in \textsc{ISO}/\textsc{IEC} 6429 \cite{iso6429}.

Additionally, the \textsc{ASCII} characters below 32, the \emph{control characters}, have special meanings in terminals.
%\Cref{sec:esc} lists the control characters and the escape sequences which are still common today.
To denote control characters, which would be invisible otherwise, \emph{caret notation} is commonly used: To represent the \textsc{ASCII} character of the value $n$, a caret symbol (\texttt{\textasciicircum}), combined with the \textsc{ASCII} character with the value $n+64$ is used. For example, the \emph{backspace} character has the \textsc{ASCII} value $8$; the \textsc{ASCII} character with the value $72$ is \texttt{H}, so the caret notation for a \emph{backspace} is \escape{H}. This notation originates from the fact that in old terminals, the control characters could be entered by pressing \keys{\ctrl} and the respective letter key. For some characters this is still true today: For example, \keys{\ctrl+D} produces \emph{end of file}, \keys{\ctrl+H} produces \emph{backspace}, and \keys{\ctrl+J} procuces \emph{line feed}.

\section{Readline}

To make text input more comfortable, many CLIs offer a wide range of editing capabilities. They support key combinations for deleting characters, words or whole lines, and often maintain a history of entered commands, so that the user can reuse them later if necessary.

To avoid having to implement these functions themselves, many command line programs use a library called \textsl{\textsc{GNU} Readline} \cite{readline}. This library has some default keybindings, which originate from the \textsc{Emacs} text editor. Even if a program does not use Readline directly, many of its bindings have become a de-facto standard for command line editing and thus can be expected to work in a command line environment.

\chapter{The \textsc{CLI} Abstraction Layer}
\label{sec:cliparser}

The \textsl{\textsc{CLI} abstraction layer} is the framework's lowest-level component, which wraps around the command line process that is to be taught. It has the goal of recognizing the different parts of the command line interaction, creating a layer of abstraction that enables the framework to treat all supported \textsc{CLI}s identically.

This layer is needed for two reasons: First, the Nut Shell needs to check conditions on the user's commands or the output. Second, it allows the Nut Shell to run commands itself, hidden to the user, while having access to the same state of the command line system.

In this thesis, the targeted command line process is treated as a black box having input and output streams of Unicode characters. The CLI abstraction layer watches and modifies these streams.

The interesting parts in this context are the following three, which correspond to the phases described in \cref{sec:cli}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which prompt is displayed to the user?
    \item Which command does he enter?
    \item What is the output of this command?
\end{enumerate}



The main idea here is to use two special \emph{markers}, unique character sequences that do not appear in normal command line interaction, to annotate the output of the process. A suitable choice for those markers are Unicode characters from the \emph{Private Use Area} \cite[p. 558]{unicode6.2}. The different components then can be recognized by the command line tokenizer. Once the framework is able to understand the program's output, it is able to do two important things:

First, it can check conditions on the different parts. This is necessary to react to the user's commands or to the output.

\section{Targets}
\label{sec:targets}

The Nut Shell is designed to support many different command line interfaces. Examples of command line programs can be found in \cref{sec:cliexamples}. When we talk about one of these programs, we call it the Nut Shell's current \emph{target}.

For the following mechanisms to work, a command line program needs to have the following two features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Freely customizable prompts.
    \item Readline-like keybindings. Mandatory are the following three key combinations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \keys{\ctrl+E} has to jump to the end of the line

            \item \keys{\ctrl+U} has to delete the momentarily entered line and puts it in an internal buffer
            
            \item \keys{\ctrl+Y} has to reinsert the content of this buffer
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

All command line programs mentioned in \cref{sec:cliexamples} have those features and thus can be used as \emph{targets}.

    \caption{Information flow between the Nut Shell's components.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:architecture} demonstrates the architecture of the tokenizer. The command line process at the bottom has both input and output streams of Unicode characters. The output is read by the \emph{tokenizer}, which splits it into tokens of the types “prompt”, “command”, or “output”. In addition to that, the \emph{tokenizer} sends characters to the program logic that originate from interactive programs and need to be displayed before the token is complete. The logic component can then check conditions on the tokens and send appropriate text to the terminal.

On the input side, the user's input is modified by the \emph{input filter} in the manner described in \cref{sec:reccmd}. The result is then given to the process as standard input. The \emph{input filter} also filters the commands given by the logic component in the same way, this is used for commands that check conditions in the process.

The EBNF grammar shown in the following sections describes how the tokenizer watching the output of the command line process works.

The output of a process as it is used in the framework consists of three segments: The prompt (with markers, see next section), the composing of the command (which can include escape sequences for editing, or can consist of several lines), and the command's output. These segments can be repeated. The command output simply consists of non marker characters:

\begin{ebnf}
Output = { PromptWithMarkers CommandComposing CommandOutput } .
CommandOutput = { NonMarker } .
NonMarker = /* every character except marker and marker2 */ .
\end{ebnf}

\section{Recognizing the prompt}

The prompt is the easiest component to recognize. As the prompt of the target process can be changed (by definition, see \cref{sec:targets}), the Nut Shell configures the prompt to start and end with a marker. While parsing, the prompt can now be identified nonambiguously. The markers simply are skipped and are not displayed to the user.

In this part of the grammar, the token we are really interested in is \texttt{Prompt}:

\begin{ebnf}
PromptWithMarkers = marker Prompt marker .
Prompt = { NonMarker } .
\end{ebnf}
%
This approach has a downside: In some command line programs it is possible to change the prompt from within the program. If the user tries to change the prompt himself, this method will no longer work.

To add support for a new command line program to the Nut Shell, one has to create a profile that specifies which options and commands are necessary to configure the prompt so it begins and ends with markers.

\todo{Example configurations for IRB and bash?}

\section{Recognizing the command}
\label{sec:reccmd}

When the user enters characters with his keyboard, normally, these characters are immediately displayed on the screen. This means that in the phase of entering a command, the input of the underlying process equals its output.

Unfortunately, this is only true for visible characters. While editing the command line, a user may use Readline's key bindings or other shell built-in key combinations that modify the currently entered command in unusual ways. These make it hard for the framework to recognize which command he entered, as parts of the entered characters could have been deleted or otherwise have been changed. To solve this, the Nut Shell uses the following mechanism to repeat the entered line between two markers before it is sent:

When the user is done editing the command, wants to run it and produces a \emph{line feed} character by pressing \keys{Return}, the Nut Shell does not send this character to the process. Instead, using the Readline key bindings, it proceeds in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The cursor is positioned at the end of the line using \keys{\ctrl+E}. This is necessary as the user could have positioned the cursor somewhere inside the command as well.
    \item A \emph{space} character is inserted. This prevents problems when the command was completely empty before, as the following step would not do anything in this case.
    \item The whole line is deleted and put into an internal buffer using \mbox{\keys{\ctrl+U}}.
    \item A marker is inserted and immediately deleted afterwards, so it does not end up in the command later.
    \item The deleted command is reinserted using \keys{\ctrl+Y}.
    \item Another marker is inserted and deleted.
    \item The \emph{space} character that was inserted in step 2 is deleted.
    \item Finally, a \emph{line feed} character is written to the process to start execution of the command.
\end{enumerate}

To summarize, this is the whole sequence as it is sent to the process:

\begin{quote}
    \keys{\ctrl+E} \keys{space} \keys{\ctrl+U} marker \keys{backspace} \keys{\ctrl+Y} marker \keys{backspace} \keys{backspace} \keys{\return}
\end{quote}

Because \keys{\ctrl+Y} repeats the whole command as the user intended to run it, it now appears in the output neatly framed by the two markers. The screen's content, however, looks the same to the user.

\begin{table}[tb]

    \caption{Example of the command marker technique.}
    \label{tab:cmdmarking}
    \begin{tabular}{r|l|l|l|l}
        & Keystrokes & Input & Output & Screen content \\

        10 & & \texttt{␣} & \texttt{␣} & \texttt{>>␣1+1␣\invert{ }} \\
        11 & & \texttt{\escape{U}} & \texttt{\escape{H}\escape{H}\escape{H}\escape{H}} & \texttt{>>␣\invert{1}+1␣} \\
        12 & & & \texttt{\escape{[}[K} & \texttt{>>␣\invert{ }} \\
        13 & & \texttt{\{marker\}} & \texttt{\{marker\}} & \texttt{>>␣\{marker\}\invert{ }} \\
        14 & & \texttt{\escape{H}} & \texttt{\escape{H}\escape{[}[K} & \texttt{>>␣\invert{ }} \\
        15 & & \texttt{\escape{Y}} & \texttt{1+1␣} & \texttt{>>␣1+1␣\invert{ }} \\
        16 & & \texttt{\{marker\}\escape{H}} & \texttt{\{marker\}\escape{H}\escape{[}[K} & \texttt{>>␣1+1␣\invert{ }} \\
        17 & & \texttt{\escape{H}} & \texttt{\escape{H}\escape{[}[K} & \texttt{>>␣1+1\invert{ }} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:cmdmarking} demonstrates the technique. The first column lists the user's keystrokes, the second one contains the characters sent to the process, the third one contains the output of the process, and the final one shows the current content of the screen. The gray rectangle indicates the cursor position. In the example, the program first writes a prompt. The user then enters \texttt{1-1}, and then replaces the \texttt{-} character with a \texttt{+} using arrow keys and \emph{backspace}. The first three characters are routed from the program's input to its output literally. In line 3, the left arrow key send the escape sequence \texttt{\escape{[}[D} to the program, which means “move the cursor backwards”. In the output, this is transformed to \texttt{\escape{H}}, a \emph{backspace} character, which has the same effect in the terminal. In line 4, the \emph{backspace} key is translated into \texttt{\escape{H}} (move the cursor backwards) and \texttt{\escape{[}[1P} (delete one character). The insertion of the \texttt{+} character has the following effect: The \texttt{+} and the text after the cursor is rewritten, and the cursor is then moved back to its position inside of the command using \texttt{\escape{H}}.

From the content of the “Output” column up to line 9, it is hard to recognize the actual command \texttt{1+1} (which is displayed on the screen). When the user presses \emph{return}, the described sequence is sent to the process. In line 9, the cursor is moved to the end of the line using \texttt{\escape{[}[C} (move the cursor forward). In line 11, the command is deleted by moving the cursor to the beginning of the line with \texttt{\escape{H}} and clearing the terminal's current line to the right with \texttt{\escape{[}[K}. After that, no new escape sequences appear: The marker is inserted and deleted, the command is repeated, another marker is inserted and deleted, and the space character is removed.

When reading the “Output” column, the correct command \texttt{1+1} now appears neatly between the two markers. After the first marker follow some deletion characters in the output (they depend on the concrete command line program, but come from a fixed character set, see \cref{sec:esc}). And after the command there is always a space character in the output. By removing both, the exact command the user wanted to enter is extracted.

In general, for the tokenizer, the composing sequence has two phases: In the first one, the actual command line composing takes place. In the second one, the current line is deleted and reprinted as described above. The interesting part here is \texttt{Command}:

\begin{ebnf}
ComposeAndRepeat = LineComposing LineRepetition .
LineComposing = { NonMarker } .
LineRepetition = Deletition Marker Deletion Command
    space Marker Deletion "\r" .
Deletition = { deletition_character } .
Command = { NonMarker } .
\end{ebnf}

\subsection*{Multi-line commands}

When the user wants to execute a command, some \textsc{CLI}s check whether this command is somehow incomplete: It could, for example, lack a closing parenthesis, or end with an operator. In this case, the program does not execute the command, but gives the user the possibility to complete it instead. For this purpose, the CLI usually displays a prompt which is different to the primary prompt, so that the user can tell the difference.

The framework inserts a second kind of marker in the secondary prompt, too, so that it can be recognized and differentiated from a normal prompt.

After the previously described line repetition, the tokenizer looks at the next character---if it is a secondary-prompt-marker, it knows another composing-and-repeating step will follow, as the user will now type a second line:

\begin{ebnf}
SecondaryPromptWithMarkers = marker2 Prompt marker2 .
CommandComposing = ComposingAndEcho
    [ { SecondaryPromptWithMarkers ComposingAndEcho } ] .
\end{ebnf}
%
When no secondary prompt follows, all occurrences of the \texttt{Command} token are appended to get the full command.

\chapter{The \emph{nutsh} Language}
\label{sec:lang}

To enable authors to write tutorials for the Nut Shell quickly, the framework supports a new \emph{domain-specific programming language} (\textsc{DSL}). This language is called \emph{nutsh}, a contraction of “Nut Shell”, which also serves as the filename extension. Files written in the \emph{nutsh} language represent “lessons”, self-contained teaching units.

%The language contains syntactic structures that support often-used semantical statements. It provides mechanisms to reuse code snippets to minimize redundancy.

%The language is string-based, the only data type is a string of Unicode characters, this keeps the language minimal. \emph{nutsh} does not have variables, which makes the language functional.

The following sections specify the language's lexical and syntactical elements in \textsc{EBNF} as defined in \cref{sec:ebnf} and describe their semantics.

Lesson files should be as easy to read and to write as possible. Because of this, \emph{nutsh} uses a syntax that is close to other languages potential users will already know. In this case, it resembles the syntax of C, with some influences of Google Go \cite{google13}, for example the definition of string literals and the syntax of \texttt{if} clauses.

Another design goal was to keep the language as small as possible, while making it powerful enough for the intended purpose. For this reason, the only data type is a string of Unicode characters, and it has no variables.

\section{Lexical elements}

\minisec{Comments}

\emph{nutsh} has two types of comments, as they exist in C-like languages: \emph{Line comments} start with \texttt{//} and stop at the end of the line, \emph{block comments} start with \texttt{/*} and end with \texttt{*/}. Comments act as white space and are ignored otherwise.

\minisec{White space}

Whites space (newlines, carriage returns, tab and space characters) seperates tokens but has no further meaning.

\minisec{Identifiers}

Identifiers serve as names that can be used for functions. An identifier is a nonempty sequence of alphanumeric characters.

\begin{ebnf}
Identifier = alnum_char { alnum_char } .
\end{ebnf}

\minisec{Keywords}

\emph{nutsh} uses the following keywords, which may not be used as identifiers:

\begin{quote}
    \texttt{break}\hspace{0.5em}
    \texttt{def}\hspace{0.5em}
    \texttt{else}\hspace{0.5em}
    \texttt{if}\hspace{0.5em}
    \texttt{prompt}\hspace{0.5em}
    \texttt{return}
\end{quote}

\minisec{Operators and delimiters}

The following character sequences have special meanings in \emph{nutsh}:

\begin{quote}
    \texttt{=\~}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{==}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{||}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{,}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{!}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{(}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{)}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{\{}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{+}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{\}}\hspace{1em}
    \texttt{\&\&}
\end{quote}

\minisec{String Literals}

There are two types of string literals: \emph{raw string literals} and \emph{interpreted string literals}. Raw string literals are enclosed with back quotes (\texttt{\`}). They may contain any character except the back quote; the characters are interpreted literally. Interpreted string literals are enclosed with double quotes (\texttt{"}) and may contain backslash escaped characters, like \texttt{\textbackslash{}n} for a newline or \texttt{\textbackslash{}"} for a double quote, and byte values in hexadecimal (\texttt{\textbackslash{}x??}) or octal form (\texttt{\textbackslash{}???}).\footnote{Due to the implementation, \emph{nutsh} accepts strings of the same format as Go \cite{google13}.}

\begin{ebnf}
string = raw_string | interpreted_string .
raw_string = "`" { unicode_char } "`" .
interpreted_string = `"` { unicode_char | escaped_char |
    byte_value } `"` .
\end{ebnf}

\section{Syntax and semantics}

\subsection{Expressions}

\minisec{String Expressions}

The \emph{nutsh} language makes strong use of strings (\texttt{"foo"}). String expressions can be concatenated (\texttt{"foo"+"foo"} has the same value as \texttt{"foofoo"}) and be checked for equality (\texttt{"foo" == "foo"}). Additionally, one can check whether a string matches a regular expression (\texttt{"foo" =\textasciitilde\ "f.."}).\footnote{Using the syntax of the regular expression parsing library \emph{RE2} as described here: \url{https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax}} Every string can be interpreted as a truth value, which is \emph{false} for an empty string and \emph{true} otherwise. The common logic operators (\texttt{!} for \emph{not}, \texttt{\&\&} for \emph{and}, and \texttt{||} for \emph{or}) are defined accordingly. They return the (arbitrary) nonempty string \texttt{"true"} as a truth value.

\begin{ebnf}
StringExpression =
    string | Call | StringExpression Operator StringExpression |
    "!" StringExpression | "(" StringExpression ")" .

Operator = "+" | "==" | "=~" | "&&" | "||" .
\end{ebnf}

\minisec{Operator precedence}

String concatenation binds strongest, followed by the two comparison operators, logical \emph{and}, and finally logical \emph{or}. Operators bind from left to right: \texttt{a OP b OP c} has the same meaning as \texttt{(a OP b) OP c}.

\minisec{Calls}

\emph{nutsh} knows \emph{functions}, which can be called by specifying the correct number of arguments. If a function takes no arguments, the brackets can be omitted. As a special case, a string on its own also acts as a function call, see the following section.

\begin{ebnf}
Call = identifier [ "(" [ StringExpressions ] ")" ] | string .
StringExpressions = StringExpression { "," StringExpression } .
\end{ebnf}

\subsection{Built-in functions}

A central command is the output of explanation text. This text will be displayed indented and highlighted in a different color.

\begin{nutsh}
say("This is explaining text.")
\end{nutsh}
%
Because this command is used so often, it can be abbreviated to:

\begin{nutsh}
"This is the short form."
\end{nutsh}
%
The \texttt{say} function supports two ways of highlighting parts of the text: Text enclosed in back quotes will be displayed in a second color, text enclosed in asterisks in a third. As a convention, back quotes are used to mark parts of commands or file names, and asterisks are used to emphazise parts of a sentence. These conventions have been adopted from John Gruber's Markdown.\footnote{\url{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax}}

The \texttt{run} function executes a command in the target process, it takes a command line to be executed as an argument. The value of this statement is the command's output.

\begin{nutsh}
run("1+1")
\end{nutsh}

\subsection{Statements}
\label{sec:statements}

\minisec{Blocks}

A \emph{block} is a sequence of lines:

\begin{ebnf}
Block = "{" { Line } "}" .
Line = IfStatement | PromptStatement | NestingStatement | Call .
\end{ebnf}

\minisec{If statements}

If the conditional expression of an \texttt{if} statement evaluates to \emph{true}, the first block is evaluated, otherwise the (optional) second block. There are no brackets around the condition.

\begin{ebnf}
IfStatement = "if" StringExpression Block ( "else" Block ) .
\end{ebnf}
%
This example checks a string for equality with itself and prints an according message:

\begin{nutsh}
if "test" == "test" {
    "Everything is OK."
} else {
    "Wait, what?"
}
\end{nutsh}

\minisec{Prompt statements}

The prompt statement is a central element of \emph{nutsh}'s syntax. It has the semantic of an endless loop, in which a command is read from the user at the beginning of each pass. It can be left with a \texttt{break} statement.

\begin{ebnf}
PromptStatement = "prompt" Block .
\end{ebnf}
%
There are two built-in functions called \texttt{command} and \texttt{output}, that correspond to the user's latest command and its output. When no prompt has occurred yet, they return empty strings.

In this example, the user is asked to enter a command that has the output “42”. When he obeys, the prompt loop is left with a \texttt{break} statement, otherwise he has to try again:

\begin{nutsh}
"Please calculate the product of 6 and 7."

prompt {
    if output == "42" {
        break
    } else {
        "Please try again."
    }
}

"Well done!"
\end{nutsh}

\minisec{Function definition}

To define a new function, the \texttt{def} keyword is used, followed by the name of the function, optional arguments and a block. The brackets around the arguments can be omitted if a function has no arguments:

\begin{ebnf}
Definition = "def" identifier [ Arguments ] Block .
Arguments = "(" [ identifier { "," identifier } ] ")" .
\end{ebnf}
%
As an example, we define a function that prints its argument twice:

\begin{nutsh}
def say_twice(text) {
    say(text)
    say(text)
}

say_twice("Hey!")
\end{nutsh}

\minisec{Nesting statements}

Sometimes, the same set of conditions needs to be checked for a group of prompt statements. In this case, nesting statements can be used. They consist of one or more function calls, followed by a block.

\begin{ebnf}
NestingStatement = Calls Block .
Calls = Call { "," Call } .
\end{ebnf}
%
At each pass of a prompt loop, after the command has been read from the user, the specified parent functions are called. There can be more than one level of nesting -- the outmost parent functions are called first.

In this example, a function is defined that prints a message when the user enters a command that contains “help”. For two \texttt{prompt} statements, a nesting statement is defined to call this function. Now every time the user enters a command in these two prompt loops, the function is called.

\begin{nutsh}
def respond_to_help {
    if command =~ "help" {
        "Sorry, you're on your own."
    }
}

respond_to_help {
    prompt {
        // break condition ...
    }
    prompt {
        // break condition ...
    }
}
\end{nutsh}
%
For another example of this syntax, refer to the implementation of the example lesson in \cref{sec:nutshexample}, starting on \cpageref{lst:compress}.

\subsection{Top level structure}

A \emph{nutsh} file consists of several function definitions and other \texttt{Line} instances (\texttt{if}-, \texttt{prompt}- and nesting statements in addition to calls, see \cref{sec:statements}). Thus, function definitions can only appear at the top level to avoid redefinitions in different scopes, which would lead to name masking problems and a much higher complexity.

\begin{ebnf}
Lesson = { Definition | Line } .
\end{ebnf}

\section{Parsing}

\emph{nutsh} has an $LR(1)$ grammar, which means it can be parsed by a bottom-up parser in a single pass from left to right, creating a rightmost derivation. For this, \emph{nutsh} uses a standard $LALR(1)$ parser generator, which is described in more detail in \cref{sec:implementation}.
The parser creates a \emph{syntax tree} whose nodes have a string value and zero or more child nodes. For leaf nodes, the string value represents the lexical value, for inner nodes, it represents the node's type.

\todo{Examples of parsed code snippets?}

\section{Interpretation}

When a function definition is encountered, the definition node along with its children is added to the symbol table. After it has been defined, the function can be called until the end of the source file. As functions can only be defined at the top level, no dedicated scoping is necessary.

When evaluating a string expression, a node's values can always be calculated from its children's values, the attribute is \emph{synthesized}. This makes an evaluation of the syntax tree especially easy, as the interpreter can now travel through the tree in a bottom-up manner. \emph{nutsh} uses \emph{lazy evaluation}: An expression is only evaluated when it is needed.

The arguments to a function are always evaluated (\emph{strict evaluation}), the resulting value is bound to the corresponding argument name in the function (\emph{call-by-value}).

While traversing the syntax tree, the interpreter keeps track of the encountered nesting function calls, which are pushed on a stack when entering the nesting statement and removed when leaving it. When a \texttt{prompt} node is encountered, the \emph{command line tokenizer} is used to prompt the user for a command. The command and it's output are saved so they can be accessed when the \texttt{input} and \texttt{output} functions are called. Next, the calls in the nesting stack are executed. Finally, the block inside the \texttt{prompt} statement is evaluated.

\section{Automated testing}
\label{sec:testing}

As the author of a tutorial, one wants to verify that all the lessons work correctly. The framework provides a function for automated testing of correctness, so one does not have to enter all the required commands by hand.

To help with this, the framework provides the built-in function \texttt{expect}, which expresses the assumption of the author that if a user were to enter the supplied argument as a command in the innermost surrounding \texttt{prompt} statement, the \texttt{expect} statement would be reached.

In this example, the user is asked to reverse a given string. The \texttt{expect} lines give two different ways to achieve it---both should work. There's also an \texttt{expect} command that should \emph{not} lead to an evaluation of the first block:

\begin{nutsh}
run("text = 'stressed'")
"Reverse the content of `text` and save it in `text2`!"
prompt {
    if test("text2 == 'desserts'") {
        "You did it!"
        expect("text2 = text.reverse")
        expect("text.reverse!; text2 = text")
        break
    } else {
        expect("text2 = 'somethingdifferent'")
    }
}
\end{nutsh}

The testing algorithm first collects all \texttt{expect} statements and creates a reference for each of them in the nearest \texttt{prompt} statement around the statement.

It then starts interpreting the file like normally, but when a \texttt{prompt} statement is encountered, instead of querying the user for a command, one of the unreached associated \texttt{expect} commands is used. When the respective \texttt{expect} statement is reached, the statement is marked as \emph{reached}. When the end of the prompt loop is reached, and the \texttt{expect} has not been reached, an error is printed and the test is aborted. At the end of the file, if there are any unreached \texttt{expect}s left, the lesson is restarted.

By convention, when a prompt is encountered whose expects are all reached, the first one is used. Thus, the first \texttt{expect} in each prompt should be one that leads to a \texttt{break} statement to ensure the testing algorithm terminates.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

For installation and usage instructions, refer to \cref{sec:usage}.

\subsection*{Used technologies}

The framework has been implemented in Google Go \cite{google13}, a compiled, statically typed language, which is seen by many as a modern successor to C. This language was a perfect fit for the Nut Shell as it is very fast and was created with low-level programming in mind. Its standard library offered nearly everything needed to implement the Nut Shell. For emulating a terminal, the small \texttt{pty} package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kr/pty}} was used.

The online survey was conducted using the open source software \emph{Limesurvey}.\footnote{\url{https://www.limesurvey.org/}}

\subsection*{Parsing}

To parse the token stream into a parse tree, the framework used \textsc{YACC}. \textsc{YACC} is a $LALR(1)$ parser generator that takes a list of token types, a grammar description and a operator precedence declaration and generates a function that takes tokens from the lexer and parses them. Go comes with its own YACC implementation.\footnote{\url{http://golang.org/cmd/yacc/}}

%(ref: http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/)

\chapter{Application and Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To find out whether the teaching method provided by the Nut Shell has any advantages compared to traditional teaching methods, we created an example tutorial and conducted a two-week course with a subsequent survey.

\section{Setting}

The \textit{Braunschweig University of Technology} has been organizing preparatory computer science courses for freshman students since 2003. This course teaches how to use UNIX-like operating systems and accompaning tools for program creation.

Until now, these topics were tought by handing out exercises on paper, which the students could work on in computer pools. For support, student assistants were provided, with about one assistant per 25 students.

In the fall semester 2013--2014, 150 students enrolled in the course. For this study, the students were split into two groups: Two thirds of the students were randomly selected to use the Nut Shell, the remaining one third worked with the previously used exercises on paper. The groups worked in two separate rooms. Each day, there were three time slots of 75 minutes each, to which the students were assigned in equal parts. The course spanned over eight days, not including a weekend and a day off.

The course roughly covered the these topics: The \textsc{UNIX} file system and how to manipulate it; various text editors like Vim, Emacs, and Gedit; process management; command line tools for text manupulation like \texttt{grep}, \texttt{sort}, or \texttt{patch}; various shell mechanism like output redirection and the command history; shell scripts; automatition with Makefiles; accessing remote servers with \textsc{SSH}; typesetting documents with \LaTeX; understanding and repairing programs written in \textit{Java}; and version control with \textit{Git}. \Cref{sec:lessons} gives a complete list of the created lessons.

The newly created \textit{Nut Shell} tutorial kept these topics and their order. The material was divided into 30 invidiual lessons, each of which covered one specific topic. Each day, new lessons were made available. In total, the tutorial contained 2875 lines of \textit{nutsh} code. It took about 30 hours to write and test the lessons. For an example lesson, refer to \cref{sec:nutshexample}.

\section{Style}

The basic structure in the Nut Shell tutorial when introducing new concepts is the following: First, a general problem is stated. The method or tool for solving these class of problems is presented using a simple example, in which the user is guided exactly what to do. After that follow several problems of increasing difficulty which the user has to solve on his own. Finally, some advanced concepts and ideas are mentioned, and the user is given some free room to experiment with those. A clear signal is communicated that the user can use to continue.

Often, goals are stated but how to achieve it is up to the user. This has to be realized by testing against \texttt{output()} and \texttt{run()} statements. At several occasions, the user can choose among several paths to continue or can determine in which order to learn about several topics. These structures are supposed to give the user a feeling of autonomy and control.

For better illustration and for a more entertaining experience, the lessons introduce several real-world metaphors for abstract concepts. For example, in a lesson about the compression of files, the user is confronted with a directory named \textit{fridge} and a large file named \textit{elephant} and is asked to put the elephant in the fridge.\footnote{This is a reference to the old joke “How do you put an elephant into a fridge? -- Open the fridge, put in the elephant, and close the door.”} To complete this task, the file has to be compressed. The lessons took place in a virtual environment that consisted of several directories named \emph{kitchen} or \emph{bedroom} and often involved files named after real-life objects.

\section{Survey}

After the sixth day, an online survey was conducted whithin both groups. In the first part, the following general questions were asked (in German):

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is your course of studies?
    \item Did you use the Nut Shell or the paper exercises?
    \item On a range from 1 (not at all) to 10 (entirely), how much do you agree to the following statements?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item I had previous knowledge about the command line.
            \item The tutorial was fun.
            \item I learned a lot in the tutorial.
            \item The exercises were too hard.
            \item I had enough time to complete the exercises.
            \item I think the material is relevant for my further education.
            \item I would recommend the tutorial to others.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item How many times did you have to ask for help per day?
\end{itemize}

The second part of the survey was a test with 11 questions about different topics of the tutorial, in an attempt to quantify how much the participants learned. The following questions were provided by a person who was uninvolved with and unaware of the content of the Nut Shell lessons to avoid a bias which could have led to asking questions the author knew the Nut Shell explained well. For evaluation, each answer was marked with either 0 points (no or wrong answer), 0.5 points (correct parts), or 1 points (complete and correct answer).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do you create the directory \texttt{abc.txt}?
    \item How do you copy the file \texttt{abc.txt} to the directory \texttt{xyz}?
    \item How can you obtain more information about the command \texttt{mv}?
    \item Name at least two ways to look at the content of the file \texttt{abc.txt}.
    \item What do you use the command \texttt{ln} for?
    \item Output all lines of the file \texttt{abc.txt} that contain the Text "Hello".
    \item What is the variable \texttt{PS1} used for?
    \item What do you use \texttt{>} and \texttt{>>} for and how do they differ?
    \item How do you archive and compress all files with the ending "123" in the current directory?
    \item What is the file \texttt{~/.bashrc} used for?
    \item You don't want to type \texttt{ls -alR} all the time, but create a short hand form. Which possibilities do you have and what is the corresponding command?
    \item What are pipes used for and how do you use them? Write an example command.
\end{enumerate}

The third batch of the questions was only given to the students who had used the Nut Shell. It is intended to assess strenghts and weaknesses of the created tutorial:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Nut Shell did a good job explaining new material.
    \item When I encountered problems, the Nut Shell gave helpful hints.
    \item The exercises were helpful to understand the topics on hand.
    \item When attending another course, I would like to use the Nut Shell again.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

For the Survey's first part, there were 64 answers in total. 52 of the participants specified they had used the Nut Shell, 11 of them had used the exercise sheets. \Cref{fig:general} juxtaposes the answers to the general questions of both groups in the form of a box plot: The circle marks the median of the answers to each question, the box contains 50\% of the answers, the whiskers reach from the minimum to the maximum answer. According to the participants, the Nut Shell users had significantly more fun and had the impression of having learned more than the paper exersice users. While there is a slight evidence that the Nut Shell users found the course easier, had less time, and thought of the topics to be more relevant, these differences are not statistically meaningful.

\section{Discussion}

The small number of participants in the exercise sheet group that were left after day 8 were a problem. The results are likely to be warped, as just those participants who had fun and learned something stayed, which explains why the scores are relatively close to each other.

That is why only the evaluation of the numbers of participants over time is really meaningful. In this case, 63.8\% of the Nut Shell users stayed until the last day. Of the exercise sheet users, only 24.4\% stayed. According to the course's organizers and former assistants, this last number is indeed typical and representative for the course. This could hint that the Nut Shell lesson motivated the students more to attend to the course. From a lecturer's perspective, this result of keeping the students motivated to attend, is highly gratifying. Of the 52 students who attended on the last day, 42 (80.8\%) actually completed the tutorial.

Another positive result is the lowered demand for external help the Nut Shell users had. In this case, the Nut Shell users on average asked half the number of questions compared to the exercise sheet group. On the one hand, this is pleasing for the students themselves, as they can learn more independently---for example, from home, where no external help is available. On the other hand, the number of required student assistants can be lowered, leading to lowered costs for the university while apparently maintaining at least the same quality of education.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

While the evaluation showed improvements regarding fun and self-assessed learning success compared to static text exercises, they were quite insignificant. In the subsequent test, the Nut Shell users even reached a lower average score. Both results are unreliable due to the large decline of participants in the control group. There is evidence, however, that the Nut Shell kept the students more motivated and allowed them to work more autonomously.

During the evaluation, the student's general feedback was very positive. Some were eager to install Linux on their own computers so they could continue to use the tutorial.

Of course, there is a lot of potential for further development. Right now, typing errors can be catched by defining some \texttt{command} checks by hand. The \texttt{expect}-Statements could be used to automate this detection of typing errors by measuring the \emph{edit distance}\footnote{For example, the Levenshtein distance, that detects insertions, deletions and substitutions \cite{levenshtein66}.} between the entered command and the expected commands. When the distance falls below a certain threshold, the correct command could be suggested to the user.

While the syntax of the \texttt{prompt} makes the semantic of the \emph{nutsh} files quite clear, in practical use it seems cumbersome, as it is repeated so often. The syntax could be simplified here so that blocks of \texttt{if} clauses imply a \texttt{prompt} block around it.

Right now, the lessons of a tutorial form a linear order. It would make sense to structure them in a dependency graph, in which the author can specify for each lesson, which other lessons have to be finished before that. This would give the user more freedom to navigate through the tutorial on his own behalf.

%goal-oriented syntax?

The users feedback while using the tutorial can be very useful to improve it. This feedback collection could be automated by recording the user's interaction and tracking their progress over time. For example, when users do not reach new \texttt{prompt} statements for a longer time, or enter disproportionately many commands in one \texttt{prompt} loop this could be an indication that this section is too hard and should get more hints. The wrong commands can also be automatically collected, analyzed, and be presented to the author so that he can create appropriate hints in the lesson.

In the evaluation, it was a problem when the students entered many commands and had to scroll the terminal output up to read the tutorial text. The Nut Shell should provide a special command to repeat the last few tutorial lines.

It's likely that the Nut Shell will be used for the upcoming preparatory courses as well. Another institute has already shown interest to use the Nut Shell for a more in-depth course on the version control software Git. During the preparatory course, a student told us he would like to use the Nut Shell to teach the command line to pupils at his old school. Development on the Nut Shell will continue and it will be released under an free license to allow others to benefit from it.

\chapter{Example Lesson}
\label{sec:nutshexample}

This is an actual lesson from the preparatory course, translated into English. It explains how to compress files and directories. The students already learned how to move and display files.

And here is the lesson's \emph{nutsh} source code. The first file contains some reusable functions shared by all lessons, the second one is the actual lesson.

\chapter{Installation and Usage}
\label{sec:usage}

The \texttt{nutsh} program takes two parameters. The second one specifies the tutorial folder. For the first parameter, there are two options: \texttt{run} will start the Nut Shell normally and present a list of lessons to the user to choose from. \texttt{test} will run all lessons in the specified tutorial in the testing mode described in \cref{sec:testing}.

To run the tutorial created for the preparatory course, a Linux distribution is required. Furthermore, the tools used in the tutorial need to be installed: Java, \texttt{pdflatex}, Git, \texttt{make}, an SSH client, a \texttt{locate} implementation, and the GNU coreutils. In case a program is missing, it can be installed at any later time.
